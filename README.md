## Xpedient project

**Online**: [https://credvue.com/](https://credvue.com/)

### NOTE: due to an unresolvable deployment issue, stylesheets are not working for the online deployment. Also, use Chrome because the spinner display malfunctions in Firefox.

**Visual Studio**: Set Xpedient as the startup project (this should be already set by default). Styles work in the local environment.

**Command Line**: Open a command window in the directory of the Xpedient project. At the prompt enter `dotnet run` and then navigate to the url indicated.

**Unit Test**: Open Test Explorer (Test > Windows > Test Explorer) to run the unit test.
